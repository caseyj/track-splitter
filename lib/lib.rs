/// # Track Splitter
/// Track_Splitter is a data science friendly package for reliably creating training and 
///     testing sets for data sets. Track splitter contains a set of functions to randomize 
///     and run common place data splitting schemes for most any objects necessary. Most 
///     functions will work on any generic, but should it not utilities are included to 
///     make them work for the indices of those generics which should allow you to randomize 
///     and split on the indicies without the data itself.
